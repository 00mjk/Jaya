**Jaya - Cross Plat** is a small .NET Core based cross platform file explorer application which runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. Its goal is very simple, *"Allow browsing and managing of several file systems simultaneously using a single application which should work and look similar on all desktop platforms it supports."*.

Application is designed to be plug-able from the ground up i.e. anyone with experience of working with .NET Framework will be able to add support for new storage services by implementing a simple plugin. Support for below mentioned storage services are complete (or planned) as of now. If you would like addition of more storage services, please raise request [here](https://github.com/waliarubal/Jaya/issues).
- [x] File System
- [x] Dropbox
- [x] Google Drive
- [ ] Apple iCloud Drive ([help wanted](https://github.com/waliarubal/Jaya/issues/17))
- [ ] Microsoft OneDrive
- [ ] Box
- [ ] IDrive
- [ ] SugarSync
- [ ] pCloud
- [ ] Media Fire
- [ ] FTP/SFTP

This project is in beta at the moment so it's not suitable for general use. Technical users with programming experience can try things out, just open the project in Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio 2019 and run it in 'Debug' mode.
